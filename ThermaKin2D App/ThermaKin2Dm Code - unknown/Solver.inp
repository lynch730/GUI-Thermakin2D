TX is a coefficient in front of the temperature of element X. YX is a coefficient in front of the mass of component Y in element X. TXc or YXc is a constant term in the temperature of element X or mass of component Y in element X balance equation. Array sol is used to store a solution of the equations. A first approximation to the solution should be input before running solve function.
